# Development Branch

This is the development branch for the Mediawiki Foreground Skin. All new features for Foreground should PR against this branch. If you want to add a new feature, you should do the following:

1. Create a branch in your repo with the name of the `feature` using Foreground's `develop` branch as a base.
2. Periodically check and pull down updates to Foreground's `develop` branch as you are working on your proposed feature. Commits to `develop` may affect your `feature` branch, so make sure all is well while you are working on it.

If you want to work on an existing feature proposed by Foreground, please see the `feature/name-of-feature` branch for more information. PRs should be issued against the specific `feature/name-of-feature` branch.
