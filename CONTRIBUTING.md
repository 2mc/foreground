# Development Branch

This is the development branch for the Mediawiki Foreground Skin. All new features for Foreground should PR against this branch. If you want to add a new feature, you should do the following:

1. Open an issue in [Issues](https://github.com/thingles/foreground/issues)
2. Create a branch in your repo with the name of the `feature` or whatever you feel comfortable with using Foreground's `develop` branch as a base.
3. Periodically check and pull down updates to Foreground's `develop` branch as you are working on your proposed feature. Commits can and will occur to `develop` which may affect your `feature` branch.
4. When you are ready to issue a PR against the `develop` branch of Foreground, please use `[feature]` as a tag at the beginning of the PR's title.
5. Please reference the issue# in the PR's description and include any information for testing the feature.

If you want to work on an existing feature proposed by Foreground, please see the `feature/name-of-feature` branch for more information. PRs should be issued against the specific `feature/name-of-feature` branch.
